KickIO is an API wrapper in Python for `Kick.com <https://kick.com/>`_, an alternative platform to streaming. KickIO is an asynchronous library,
designed around `asyncio <https://docs.python.org/3.9/library/asyncio.html>`_. 

Warning
========
KickIO is an _experimental_ library based on a rapidly changing API. Kick has not made their API properly accessible to third parties yet,
so this library may break due to unannounced changes!

Documentation
==============
Not a thing yet.

Support & Development
========
I really don't recommend using this library yet, especially as a beginner. I do not have much spare time, and I would prefer to spend that spare time developing.
If you are interested in aiding in the development of this library, please join me on `Discord <https://discord.gg/UrJCEkSSqu>`_. 
Please note that I am not interested in any sort of AI generated contributions.
